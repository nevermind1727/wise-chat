# Realtime Chat Application
![Conversation example](https://i.imgur.com/9wlRFc4.png)
## Project Description
This is the Realtime Chat Application project that I have built from the
ground up. It is used for realtime communication between people where
you can create conversations with many of different users. I have also integrated ChatGPT into this project, which allows you to create a conversation with artificial intelligence. This will help, for example, translate sentences into different languages, allowing you to communicate with people all over the world!

Technologies used in the project:
Frontend:
  * Next.js
  * Chakra UI 
  * GraphQL Apollo Client.

Backend:
  + Nest.js
  + MySQL
  + Prisma
  + GraphQL
  + Websockets
## Improvements and additions
I want to emphisize that this is only a MVP version of the project, meaning, there may be some bugs and flaws. 
However, I will work on improving the project, adding new features and fixing bugs.

### Basic Plan for Project Improvement:
  * Add the ability to edit the conversation.
  * Add the ability to send files in messages.
  * Add different providers for authorization, such as Facebook, Linkedin, Github and so on, also add local authorization.
  * Implement audio and video calls.
